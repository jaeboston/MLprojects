## Project Description<a name="project"></a>

We can easily come across many marketing articles and blog posts claiming substantial booking increases by following their formula to write listing titles and descriptions.

This post will analyze Airbnb listings data to compare the words used in the top-rated listings with ones used in worst-rated listings using publicly available Airbnb listing data for the Boston area.

These are three questions we will answer in this post.

1. What are the most frequently used ten words in Titles and Descriptions in Airbnb listings.
2. What are the most frequently used ten words in Titles and Descriptions for top-rated Airbnb listings.
3. What are the most frequently used ten words in Titles and Descriptions for poorly rated AirBnB listings
