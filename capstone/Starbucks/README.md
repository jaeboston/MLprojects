## Project Description<a name="project"></a>

Starbucks sends out various promotional offers to its app users. As a Capstone project, we will have simulated data that mimics customer response to those promotional offers. Using the data set,  we will build machine learning(ML) models to predict if a user is likely to complete a particular type of promotions offer.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
